INFO 201 Final Project Proposal

Growing up in downtown Seattle, we’ve experienced firsthand how our community has changed over the years. One of the most significant shifts we’ve witnessed has been the fentanyl epidemic. The highly potent and dangerous drug has not caused only our city devastation but other major metropolitan cities and small towns as well. It has led to a national crisis and a substantial increase in overdoses and deaths.

Through this project, we intend to highlight the impact of the fentanyl epidemic on different cities in the United States. Therefore, we hope that our examinations can spotlight how this drug has impacted the cities we thrive in detailed factors through common denominators.
As illustrated, fentanyl has contributed to an increase in overdose deaths amongst younger individuals. The number of overdose deaths among individuals aged 25 to 34 has increased dramatically in recent years, with fentanyl being a significant factor. This is a concerning trend that highlights the urgent need for action to address this crisis. Additionally, the fentanyl epidemic has impacted people across the socioeconomic spectrum, and it is vital to figure out which class is more vulnerable to this type of drug.

Lastly, we aim to explore the responses of different cities and communities to the fentanyl epidemic. Some areas have implemented harm reduction strategies such as naloxone distribution and safe injection sites; others have focused on cracking down on drug trafficking and increasing access to addiction treatment. By examining the different approaches taken by cities, we hope to shed light on the various ways in which this crisis is being addressed.

Overall, we believe that this story is important and compelling because it highlights a crisis that is affecting communities across the country. With fentanyl overdoses continuing to rise, it is evident that it is affecting individuals and communities from all walks of life. Whether you or someone you know has struggled with addiction, or you have walked by fentanyl users in the city, it is a devastating tragedy occurring in American cities. Furthermore, the fentanyl epidemic has highlighted broader issues related to drug policy, healthcare access, and socioeconomic inequality, making it a critical issue for anyone interested in social justice and public health. As a result, by engaging with this issue and working to address the root causes of addiction and drug-related harm, we can help create a safer and more equitable future for all members of our society.

We found two independent datasets that come from two independent sources. The first dataset, Drug overdoses vs age, was collected using services the National Safety Council holds such as employee perception surveys and assessments collected and analyzed. In this case, the National Safety Council analysis of National Center for Health (NCHS)--Mortality Data for 1999-2020, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. The data displays statistics regarding drug poisoning deaths in comparison to gender, intent, drug type, and age group for the year 1999-2021 and for people residing in the US. This dataset has 1380 observations (rows) and 5 features with the 5th feature containing 13 features (columns).

For the second dataset, Health Insurance Coverage Status and Type of Coverage by Selected Characteristics for Working Age Adults, the data was collected using information from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement. The CPS is a cooperation effort between the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. The data displays the total number of people and their insurance status (private, public, uninsured) in comparison to age, race, religion, nativity, family status, household income, and work experience for working adults ages 19-64 for people residing in the US. This dataset has 80 observations (rows) and 23 features (columns).  (https://millennialcities.com/homeless-population-by-state-homelessness-maps/)

Additionally, the following sources are ones we found from doing background research that inspired us to dig deeper into the fentanyl and drug epidemic.
_“Drug Overdoses” by nsc Injury Facts_
URL: https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/drugoverdoses/data-details/
- Our proposed project idea is similar to this source as both topics focus on drug usage in the U.S.. The article includes different kinds of drugs, the ages of users, and data throughout 1998-2022 about drug overdose which is what we would like to focus on.
- Our project idea will not solely focus on age and drug overdose. We want to look into different factors as well such as location and income while specifically focusing on the drug fentanyl.

_“'It's scary': Overdose deaths driven by fentanyl mixed with other drugs” By Phil McCausland_
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/-scary-overdose-deaths-driven-fentanyl-mixed-drugs-rcna6605
- Our proposed project idea also wants to focus on fentanyl use as discussed in the article. The article also talks about the effects of mixing fentanyl in existing drugs compared to taking them individually which we would like to focus on as well. We would also like to see some geospatial data about which communities fentanyl is affecting.
- The article discusses addiction services which our project will not be going into.

_“Opioid overdose” by World Health Organization_
URL: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/opioid-overdose
- We like how this article gives a big overview of the opioid issue by comparing them to the overall population of people who used drugs. They also include death rates and percentages relating to the overall population. We want to look more specific than that.
- The article talks about the origins of these drugs (where they are cultivated and manufactured) which we will most likely not be looking at. Also, opioids will not be the only drug we will be looking at.

_“'Gummies, candies, cookies': State Crime Lab opens, sees critical levels of fentanyl in many items” by Akilah Davis_
URL: https://abc11.com/fentanyl-north-carolina-new-crime-lab-drug-addiction/13155950/
- Our project and this article both address the severity of the fentanyl epidemic and why we should care about it. The article specifically addresses how the North Carolina State Crime Lab has recently detected critical levels of fentanyl in many items such as in candies, gummies, and cookies. The article also includes numeric data about overdose deaths likely caused by fentanyl.
- Instead of exploring data about what items have fentanyl, we are focusing on fentanyl death rates.

_“Use and Abuse of Alcohol and Illicit Drugs in US Adolescents” by Joel Swendsen, Marcy Burstein, and Brady Case_
URL: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1151056
- This study is similar to our proposed project idea because both address drug usage and are observed by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
- While we want to look at drug usage on a more large scope, this article focuses on only adolescents. It also addresses alcohol use which we won’t be looking at.
